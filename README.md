escape analysis in golang



## Stack:
Stack is a block of memory allotted to each function. Memory is calculated on compile time.

## Heap:
Heap is a block of memory allotted demanded by your software at runtime.
Before goes into deep some terms must know

## Escape Analysis:

Gc compiler does global escape analysis across function and package boundaries. It checks a memory that it really needs to be allocated at a heap or it could be managed within a stack itself.

## Function Inlining:
Only short and simple functions are inlined. Function inlining is nothing but the whole code replaces the function call.

## Command For Escape Analysis:
```
go build -gcflags="-m"

```


## 1. Stack analysis 

````
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func init(){}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("main function")
	smallAllocation()
}
type smallStruct struct {
	a, b int64
	c, d float64
 }
 
 //go:noinline
 func smallAllocation() *smallStruct {
	return &smallStruct{}
 }

````

``
 $ go build -gcflags="-m"
 ``
 ```
 ./main.go:7:6: can inline init.0
./main.go:10:13: inlining call to fmt.Println
./main.go:20:9: &smallStruct literal escapes to heap
./main.go:10:14: "main function" escapes to heap
./main.go:10:13: []interface {} literal does not escape
<autogenerated>:1: .this does not escape
 ```

The meaning of escapes to the heap is variables needs to be shared across the function stack frames.

As function has it’s own variables so that is also allocated to the stack somewhere. And when the function returns then all variables associated with that function also getting removed from memory. So compiler does free from its job done called Garbage collection.

## Example 2 

```
package main

import "fmt"
func main() {
   test()
}

func test() {
   fmt.Println("Called heapAnalysis", heapAnalysis())
   x := 45
   fmt.Println("Called x", x)
   fmt.Println("Called allocation ", new(1,2))
}
//go:noinline
func heapAnalysis() *int {
   data := 55 
   return &data
}

type alloc struct {
   a int32
   b int32
}

func new(a,b int32) *alloc {
   return &alloc{
      a : a,
      b : b,
   }
}

```
``
go build -gcflags="-m"
``
```
./main.go:25:6: can inline new
./main.go:9:15: inlining call to fmt.Println
./main.go:11:15: inlining call to fmt.Println
./main.go:12:41: inlining call to new
./main.go:12:15: inlining call to fmt.Println
./main.go:4:6: can inline main
./main.go:16:4: moved to heap: data
./main.go:9:16: "Called heapAnalysis" escapes to heap
./main.go:9:15: []interface {} literal does not escape
./main.go:11:16: "Called x" escapes to heap
./main.go:11:16: x escapes to heap
./main.go:11:15: []interface {} literal does not escape
./main.go:12:16: "Called allocation " escapes to heap
./main.go:12:41: &alloc literal escapes to heap
./main.go:12:15: []interface {} literal does not escape
./main.go:26:11: &alloc literal escapes to heap
<autogenerated>:1: .this does not escape
```

 As function has it’s own variables so that is also allocated to the stack somewhere. But compiler do checks that value returned its pointer and that value used to another function so variable moved to a heap and now main function access that variable from the heap.
